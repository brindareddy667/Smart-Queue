# Smart-Queue
In a world of constant change waiting in long queues is not just inconvenient but also inefficient. Traditional queuing methods frequently result in discomfort, wasteful time, and poor management, especially in environments like service centers, government facilities, and hospitals. To deal with this problem, digital queue management systems are becoming progressively relevant. This case study analyzes the development of a Smart Queue System using QR code integration and Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The system is intended to simplify the queuing process by allowing users to join queues digitally, receive estimated wait times, and keep track of their position in real-time through a user-friendly interface.
